            <p>The Master of Arts (MA) in Multimedia with a Concentration in Interaction Design is a unique interdisciplinary program that focuses on creating interactive applications and objects as part of a designed user experience. It emphasizes the creative
              and technical aspects of current and emerging technologies and their use in creating, controlling, delivering, and presenting compelling content in an interactive form. Plus, it draws from elements in a number of fields including art, computer
              science, journalism, psychology, and telecommunications.</p>

            <p>In addition to a focus on Interaction Design (IxD), the master's degree in Multimedia draws heavily from User Experience (UX) and Human Centered Design (HCD) as well as design thinking strategies used to create interactive applications and objects
              as part of a designed user experience. Key program features include the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Access to student research grants and mentorship</li>
              <li>An artists studio and fabrication spaces</li>
              <li>An engaged faculty</li>
              <li>Contemporary art and theory</li>
              <li>Courses in emerging methods</li>

            <h4>STEM Designation (CIP 09.0702)</h4>
            <p>The Master of Arts in Multimedia with a Concentration in Interaction Design is a STEM Designated (CIP 09.0702) program and qualifies for the STEM OPT extension.</p>
            <p>Multimedia is a STEM field, which means it integrates elements of four disciplines: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This designation makes it possible for international students (with F-1 status) to apply for the 24-month
              Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT). The program allows students who've completed their degrees to obtain practical training through jobs that directly pertain to their fields of study.</p>

          <p>The average cost of a 1 bedroom apartment is: $2,022 per month. The room and Board expenses included in the off-campus cost of attendance represent the typical costs students pay when enrolled a CSU East Bay. Actual costs of room and board will
            vary. Many students living off-campus have roommates, which decreases their housing costs.

            <h4>Two Year M.A. in Interaction Design</h4>
            <p>The Multimedia master's is a two-year degree program. Most coursework is offered in the evening. During the first year, students develop a theoretical foundation in multimedia technology, enhance their creative skills, and learn to work effectively in teams. During the second year, small teams of students with various backgrounds and talents create innovative, professional-quality interactive multimedia projects. Ideas for group projects can originate from students, faculty, or external sources. Many of CSU Eastbay's student projects have won national and international awards.</p>
<h5>Pathways for Non-majors</h5>
<p>For students who have compelling backgrounds in other disciplines, we also offer pathways to an M.A. in Multimedia with a concentration in Interaction Design that includes additional coursework.</p>
<p>Based on review and consultation with the admission committee, we can offer a 3-year program starting in the preceding fall to students who have the passion but lack prior experience in the production and design of interactive experiences. A three-year option means that you will start in the fall semester and complete a year of preliminary courses before joining the regular cohort in the following year.</p>

Students learn the skills needed to adapt quickly to new environments - a valuable asset for any profession. Because multimedia is a rapidly developing and rapidly changing field, the program focuses as much on the enduring creative process as on the transient technology.</p>

            <h4>Benefits of the CSU East Bay Graduate Program</h4>
            <p>Students in the Multimedia graduate program enjoy a number of benefits including small student-teacher ratios and a dedicated interdisciplinary faculty. Thesis project students have 24-hour access to their own professional-quality multimedia
              production studio. These facilities are well equipped and maintained with the latest technology. Students can use the full maker space with a 60 watt laser cutter, many 3d printers, and CNC milling machines. They have access to the bronze foundry, a
              full metal shop, and a wood shop.</p>

            <p>Participation in events like Game Jams and Hackathons enables students to gain hands-on experience; strengthens their team building skills; and provides networking opportunities with fellow students, faculty members, and industry professionals.
              Students also participate in faculty-led research initiatives including collaborations with other disciplines that enhance their theoretical education and provide research experience.</p>

            <h4>Career Opportunities</h4>
            <p>Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, the epicenter of the interactive digital media industry and technological innovation, the Multimedia graduate program prepares students for successful careers across multiple growing industries.</p>

            <p>Interaction Designers create meaningful relationships between people and their interactive digital products, environments, systems, or services. Creative Technologists are both strategists and innovators - technology-focused individuals integrated
              into a creative team. They are integrators who blur the lines between technology and the creative to create new ways of telling stories using technology.</p>
